This is a Workshop exercise for Designers during Devfest June 2014.

Instructions - 

DO NOT LOOK AT THE SOLUTIONS

In the root directory, you'll see 3 files, core.html.erb, frontrow.html.erb, edm.html.erb

Don't choose one just because its your main project, choose one based on your comfortability with HAML and Ruby markup.  In order of difficulty:
  
  1. Frontrow.html.erb
  2. Core.html.erb
  3. Edm.html.erb

Translate these files into HAML markup preserving the original Ruby erb.  Don't worry about deciphering what its doing, but use it with its existing implementation guidelines to determine tabbing and indentation for your new markup. 

Work together, help your friendly coworkers, and have fun with this.

Please ask for any help or guidelines.
